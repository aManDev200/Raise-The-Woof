            <li>For purposes of the applicable Data Protection Laws, Freyda Limited is the “data controller”. This means that Freyda Limited determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, your Data is processed.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="use">Data collected</div>
        <p><ul>
            We may collect the following Data, which includes personal Data, from you:
            <li>name;</li>
            <li>contact Information such as email addresses and telephone numbers;</li>
            <li>in each case, in accordance with this privacy policy.</li>

        </p>
        <div class="use">How we collect Data</div>
        <p><ul>
            We collect Data in the following ways:
                <li>data is given to us by you; and</li>
                <li>data is collected automatically.</li>
            </ul>
        <div class="use">Data that is given to us by you</div>
        <p><ul>
            RTW will collect your Data in a number of ways, for example:
            <li>when you contact us through the Website, by telephone, post, e-mail or through any other means;</li>
            <li>when you register with us and set up an account to receive our products/services;</li>
            <li>when you elect to receive marketing communications from us;</li>
            <li>in each case, in accordance with this privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
        <div class="use">Our use of Data</div>
        <p><ul>
            Any or all of the above Data may be required by us from time to time in order to provide you with the best possible service and experience when using our Website. Specifically, Data may be used by us for the following reasons:
            <li>record keeping;</li>
            <li>improvement of our products / services;</li>
            <li>transmission by email of marketing materials that may be of interest to you;</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
            <b>In each case, in accordance with this privacy policy.</b>

            <li>We may use your Data for the above purposes if we deem it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests. If you are not satisfied with this, you have the right to object in certain circumstances (see the section headed “Your rights” below).</li>
            <li>For the delivery of direct marketing to you via e-mail, we’ll need your consent, whether via an opt-in or soft-opt-in:
            soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies when you have previously engaged with us (for example, you contact us to ask us for more details about a particular product/service, and we are marketing similar products/services). Under “soft opt-in” consent, we will take your consent as given unless you opt-out.
            for other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent; that is, you need to take positive and affirmative action when consenting by, for example, checking a tick box that we’ll provide.
            if you are not satisfied about our approach to marketing, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. To find out how to withdraw your consent, see the section headed “Your rights” below.</li>
            <li>When you register with us and set up an account to receive our services, the legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract.</li>
            </ol>
        <div class="use">Your rights</div>
        <p><ul>
            You have the following rights in relation to your Data:
            <li>Right to access – the right to request (i) copies of the information we hold about you at any time, or (ii) that we modify, update or delete such information. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this, unless your request is “manifestly unfounded or excessive.” Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request, we will tell you the reasons why.</li>
            <li>Right to correct – the right to have your Data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
            Right to erase – the right to request that we delete or remove your Data from our systems.
            Right to restrict our use of your Data – the right to “block” us from using your Data or limit the way in which we can use it.</li>
            <li>Right to data portability – the right to request that we move, copy or transfer your Data.</li>
            <li>Right to object – the right to object to our use of your Data including where we use it for our legitimate interests.</li>
            <li>To make enquiries, exercise any of your rights set out above, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your Data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your Data), please contact us via this e-mail address: info@example.com</li>            
            <li>If you are not satisfied with the way a complaint you make in relation to your Data is handled by us, you may be able to refer your complaint to the relevant data protection authority. For the UK, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO’s contact details can be found on their website at https://ico.org.uk/.</li>
            <li>It is important that the Data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Data changes during the period for which we hold it.</li>

            <li>Unless otherwise agreed, no delay, act or omission by a party in exercising any right or remedy will be deemed a waiver of that, or any other, right or remedy.</li>
